# `vs`
Data analysis suite for manipulation of FRC scouting data.

Originally designed for [VictiScout](https://github.com/frc1418/VictiScout) data, but also works with [XScout](https://github.com/Team612/XScout)'s and any other JSON-formatted scouting data.

Disclaimer: [VictiScout](https://github.com/frc1418/VictiScout) now contains the features to process data by itself. This tool still functions but will not receive future updates.

## Installation
* Install `python3`.
* Clone the `vs` repository and move into it:

        git clone https://github.com/frc1418/vs && cd vs

* Run `sudo make install` to install `vs` and its manpage.

## Commands
Commands are being added as needed, so for now they're few. That will gradually change.
* `vs cons` - consolidate all JSON scouting data files in the working directory into one.
* `vs csv`/`spreadsheet`/`ss` - convert raw JSON file into a CSV spreadsheet. [drv](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/drv) can be used to easily send this file to Google Drive for manipulation without any proprietary programs.
* `vs conf` - remove duplicate matches.
